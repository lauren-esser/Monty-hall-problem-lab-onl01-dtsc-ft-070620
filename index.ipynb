{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# The Monty Hall Problem\n","\n","## Introduction\n","\n","The Monty Hall problem is a famous little puzzle from a game show. It goes like this: you are presented with 3 doors. Behind two are goats and behind the third is a car. You are asked to select a door; if you select the door with the car, you win! After selecting, the host then opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing a goat. The host then asks if you would like to switch doors or stick with your original choice. What would you do? Does it matter?\n","\n","<img src=\"images/Image_58_MontyHall.png\">\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","In this lab you will:\n","\n","- Use Bayes' theorem along with a simulation to solve the Monty Hall problem"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Run a simulation\n","\n","This is not a traditional application of Bayes' theorem, so trying to formulate the problem as such is tricky at best. That said, the scenario does capture the motivating conception behind Bayesian statistics: updating our beliefs in the face of additional evidence. With this, you'll employ another frequently used tool Bayesians frequently employ, running simulations. To do this, generate a random integer between one and three to represent the door hiding the car. Then, generate a second integer between one and three representing the player's selection. Then, of those the contestant did not choose, select a door concealing a goat to reveal. Record the results of the simulated game if they changed versus if they did not. Repeat this process a thousand (or more) times. Finally, plot the results of your simulation as a line graph. The x-axis should be the number of simulations, and the y-axis should be the probability of winning. (There should be two lines on the graph, one for switching doors, and the other for keeping the original selection.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid syntax (<ipython-input-7-2ec3684dcf46>, line 32)","traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"<ipython-input-7-2ec3684dcf46>\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m32\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    print('Chance of Winning Keeping Selected Door: ', (np.mean(stay)*100)'%')\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m                                                                            ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"]}],"source":["# Your code here\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline \n","\n","stay = []\n","switch = []\n","for i in range(10**4):\n","    car = np.random.randint(1, 4, size=1)\n","    players_selection = np.random.randint(1, 4, size=1)\n","    goats = [door for door in [1, 2, 3] if door != car and door != players_selection]\n","    door_revealed = np.random.choice(goats)\n","    if_switch = [door for door in [1, 2, 3] if door != players_selection and door != door_revealed][0]\n","    #results if contestant changes doors\n","    if if_switch == car:\n","        switch.append(1)\n","    else:\n","        switch.append(0)\n","    #results if contestant stays\n","    if players_selection == car:\n","        stay.append(1)\n","    else:\n","        stay.append(0)\n","#plot results\n","plt.plot(range(1,10**4+1), [np.mean(stay[:i]) for i in range(1, 10**4+1)], label=\"Staying with Selected Door\")\n","plt.plot(range(1, 10**4+1), [np.mean(switch[:i]) for i in range(1, 10**4+1)], label= \"Switching Selected Door\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Probability of Winning\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"Number of Simulations\")\n","plt.title(\"Simulated Probability of Winning the Monty Hall Game\")\n","plt.legend()\n","print('Simulated Probabilities:')\n","print('Chance of Winning Keeping Selected Door: ', (np.mean(stay)*100))\n","print('Chance of Winning Switching Selected Door: ', (np.mean(switch)*100))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Summary\n","\n","In this lab, you further investigated the idea of Bayes' theorem and Bayesian statistics in general through the Monty Hall problem.
